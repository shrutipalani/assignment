                                    <h5>Sometimes, I think to myself, whether I’ am bothering you, sending so much text massages. But I know you love me too. Coz, I remember last month, you told me that “you loved me”. It was just twenty seven days back. It’s fine …you don’'t want to say that “you love me all the time. I know …perhaps I wish too much or my expectations are too high. And you are not that kind of boy who is always in love. Though I was looking forward to meet you on last Sunday, you got some work which cannot be postponed.  I understand.<br>
                                        For the last three months we met only for two times. I was asking for another date, for last three weeks. But you kept telling busy, every day. Sometimes I think, “Do you really love me?” Perhaps you may not love me anymore, or you may have another girl friend. Again I think , you are busy. That’s the truth.

I tried to call you several times. Most of the times, either your mobile is busy or switched off.I can'’t question you the reasons for that. It is not my type. I know you got your own life, your life is yours, though we are lovers.  And your own privacy, I am I always respect it. I never dig in to that. But the same time, you always know that, how much I love you and how much I like to spend the time with you.<br>
Well ….I must sleep now; it’s almost 2 am. But before I go to bed, I must send you a text, saying “I love you, my darling”. It is my daily habit. I know you must be sleeping now and perhaps your phone is switched off. It doesn’t really matter to me. What matter really is, telling “I love you”, all the times.

"Oh… gosh" my line is disconnected, payment delayed!. What should I do now? Ah, I got a pre-paid connection for some other matter. But where is that? Where did I keep it? My memory is a mess. How can I find it out in the middle of the night? I murmured to myself… “"Necessity has no barriers or limits"”.  I must find it, right now.<br>
I was searching my room upside down…. looking everywhere in my room. In my book cupboards, under my mattress, in my pillow covers, Each and every drawer. Where would it be? Finally… “"Bingo"”. It’s in a picture-frame, which framed the picture of you. But will you recognize this number? I’m sure…, I never dialled you or did text you from this number before. So what should I do now? I think "its OK", because you must be sleeping now. So you read this massage tomorrow, anyway. By the time I could pay my mobile bill and activate my connection again, early in the morning. So, I can tell you about the strange number.<br>

I inserted the SIM card to the mobile and typed the texts. But instantly, it sent two blank massages to you. I was like…” "Ooops",” It made me laugh and I kept typing the text, now all set to send the message to you. When I touch with my finger on the ‘send button” my phone rang….<br>

Miracle... It’s you. You are calling me at 3.00am…. I can’t believe this. I jumped out of my bed, my head over feet. How could you recognize my number? "Ok… Ok …that doesn’t matter"... you are calling me anyhow …I knew you love me, I knew it …only thing is you bit busy.  This is my fault... this is totally my fault...always I'm exaggerating...You are just great.<br>
picked the phone…, before I say you, even “Hello”….. You started to keep saying that…<br>

“"Who is this? Do I know you…? Hello …who is this, at this time?" ”<br>

I couldn't say anything, I just hung up the phone. Everything is clear like a crystal…. you have enough time to call and check a number which you never known before. Even at 3.00AM... And within a minute...<br>

You don’t have ten seconds of time to type “"Hi”" to me who is sending thousands of messages, saying “ I love you my darling”. But you responded to this unknown number within a minute? This is really OK. …It enlightened me, that “necessity is the key”. If you really want something or if you really want someone you find the time for them. I realized... I am  a big headache for you. From tomorrow morning, only grief and agonizing pain will  remain with me, but you...<br>

you will be free “my darling<br>

                                           <b><i>sometimes you need freedom. Perhaps you may think, being in the same nest always is an imprisonment. I understand that. Suddenly you  fly far away. You never tell me, where you are going. I never ask you. You are always like that.

                                                When I woke up in this morning, I searched for you. Then I realized you are not by my side. I remember very well, last night you were sleeping with me, just by my side. Before you fell into sleep, you touched my weary feathers with your pinky beak. It was not a dream. Because I can see one of your feather's inside my nest.
                                               
                                                This is your routine. You do this from time to time. Perhaps, this nest is not warm and comfortable enough for you. Maybe, you don't like to eat the same food everyday. Same ambiance every day, that’s boring. I know, you are different than me. You think like a rebel, you dream about life always, you can never be a caged bird. That's why I like you this much too.
                                               
                                                I remember one of my great grandparents told:
                                               
                                                “There are birds that fly very far, even over the oceans, so they can migrate to other countries. They can avoid hard times & difficult places.  One day they come again when everything is fine." 
                                               
                                                I am amazed, I’m not that type. Once I remember, when I went to the village by mistake, one boy pointed at me & said:
                                               
                                                “Here, Look at this…. it is an “endemic bird”...</i></b></p>

Coz, I remember last month, you told me that “you loved me”. It was just twenty seven days back. It’s fine …you don’'t want to say that “you love me all the time. I know …perhaps I wish too much or my expectations are too high. And you are not that kind of boy who is always in love. Though I was looking forward to meet you on last Sunday, you got some work which cannot be postponed.  I understand.<br>
                                                                    For the last three months we met only for two times. I was asking for another date, for last three weeks. But you kept telling busy, every day. Sometimes I think, “Do you really love me?” Perhaps you may not love me anymore, or you may have another girl friend. Again I think , you are busy. That’s the truth.
                            
                            I tried to call you several times. Most of the times, either your mobile is busy or switched off.I can'’t question you the reasons for that. It is not my type. I know you got your own life, your life is yours, though we are lovers.  And your own privacy, I am I always respect it. I never dig in to that. But the same time, you always know that, how much I love you and how much I like to spend the time with you.<br>
                            Well ….I must sleep now; it’s almost 2 am. But before I go to bed, I must send you a text, saying “I love you, my darling”. It is my daily habit. I know you must be sleeping now and perhaps your phone is switched off. It doesn’t really matter to me. What matter really is, telling “I love you”, all the times.
